2023-06-02T23:09:36+00:00,Apple bulls are bracing for a Tim Cook ‘flex’ moment,"Depending on who you ask, the the number of mixed reality headsets that Apple will sell this year varies considerably.

More from Fortune: 5 side hustles where you may earn over $20,000 per year—all while working from homeLooking to make extra cash? This CD has a 5.15% APY right nowBuying a house? Here's how much to saveThis is how much money you need to earn annually to comfortably buy a $600,000 home

Analysts at TD Cowen estimate Apple could sell as many 1 million of the headsets in the first year. Wedbush analyst Dan Ives reckons that Apple will sell 150,000 of the devices.

One thing the estimates have in common though is that they are all well below similar products already on the market. Take Meta’s second-generation Quest virtual reality headset model for instance, which shipped 10 million units in the year after its release.

That may seem shocking for Apple, the company that ushered in the smartphone revolution with  the iPhone. Isn’t Apple the company that’s supposed to make headsets a must-have product?

When it comes to mixed reality and headsets, even Apple bulls are being cautious. But they're cautiously optimistic.

Apple is due to plant its flag in the first new product category in years when it unveils a standalone headset at Monday’s Worldwide Developers Conference. The headset, likely named “Reality Pro,” will be able to handle virtual reality and augmented reality, and based on reports from Bloomberg and The Information, will feature a slew of slick innovations.

It won’t be cheap though, with a price estimated somewhere between $2,500 to $3,000. At the high end, that's about $2,400 more than a Meta Quest 2 headset costs now. The high price is one reason why analysts have modest expectations for the Apple headset out of the gate “We believe the AR/XR headset opportunity is still in its early growth phases,” said TD Cowen in its report, predicting a cheaper model in 2024.

Longtime Apple analyst Gene Munster, at Deepwater Asset Management, speculates that the price of the Apple headset could come down to $700 by 2027. That could open the floodgates to Apple selling as many as 75 million units by 2030, the headset’s eighth year on the market. That translates to $53 billion in annual revenue, which Munster estimates could represent 10% of Apple’s total sales in 2030.

Not bad, but not the iPhone, which accounted for more than 50% of Apple’s revenue in its eighth year.

Perhaps mass market consumers just aren't as sold on the idea of wearing a headset, be it for virtual reality, augmented reality, or mixed reality. But a ""killer app"" can change everything.

[story continues below, after video]

Apple’s advantage is the estimated army of 34 million iOS developers, according to TD Cowen reports. If it can use the content available on the App Store and in the native software ecosystem, the headset can start off with a strong base and build from there. Apple has been preparing its developer community for this moment since 2017 with the introduction of augmented reality developer tools. The combination means allows Apple to give headset users a smooth-screened environment of “gaming, streaming video, conferencing capabilities, health or fitness apps, and with a range of capabilities that Apple will integrate with its other devices,” says a Wedbush report.

And new A.I. innovations—which some industry observers believe Apple will also unveil at WWDC—could expand the range of possibilities for what a headset does even further.

It’s a “flex the muscles moment for Cook and Cupertino,” said Daniel Ives, a managing director at Wedbush, describing the headset as a ""potential game-changer"" in hardware, VR and A.I.

“It will ultimately lead to a broader AI strategy that Cook will lay out next week,"" Ives said.

2023-06-02T21:45:14+00:00,Apple (AAPL) Gains But Lags Market: What You Should Know,"Apple (AAPL) closed the most recent trading day at $180.95, moving +0.48% from the previous trading session. This change lagged the S&P 500's 1.45% gain on the day. At the same time, the Dow added 2.12%, and the tech-heavy Nasdaq gained 5.41%.

Coming into today, shares of the maker of iPhones, iPads and other products had gained 8.63% in the past month. In that same time, the Computer and Technology sector gained 10.26%, while the S&P 500 gained 1.53%.

Apple will be looking to display strength as it nears its next earnings release. In that report, analysts expect Apple to post earnings of $1.18 per share. This would mark a year-over-year decline of 1.67%. Meanwhile, our latest consensus estimate is calling for revenue of $81.11 billion, down 2.23% from the prior-year quarter.

For the full year, our Zacks Consensus Estimates are projecting earnings of $5.99 per share and revenue of $384.49 billion, which would represent changes of -1.96% and -2.5%, respectively, from the prior year.

Investors might also notice recent changes to analyst estimates for Apple. These revisions help to show the ever-changing nature of near-term business trends. As such, positive estimate revisions reflect analyst optimism about the company's business and profitability.

Our research shows that these estimate changes are directly correlated with near-term stock prices. We developed the Zacks Rank to capitalize on this phenomenon. Our system takes these estimate changes into account and delivers a clear, actionable rating model.

Ranging from #1 (Strong Buy) to #5 (Strong Sell), the Zacks Rank system has a proven, outside-audited track record of outperformance, with #1 stocks returning an average of +25% annually since 1988. Within the past 30 days, our consensus EPS projection has moved 0.32% lower. Apple is currently a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

Investors should also note Apple's current valuation metrics, including its Forward P/E ratio of 30.05. For comparison, its industry has an average Forward P/E of 8.83, which means Apple is trading at a premium to the group.

Also, we should mention that AAPL has a PEG ratio of 2.4. This metric is used similarly to the famous P/E ratio, but the PEG ratio also takes into account the stock's expected earnings growth rate. AAPL's industry had an average PEG ratio of 2.4 as of yesterday's close.

2023-06-02T20:05:01+00:00,Meta vs. Apple: Why VR still needs its 'hero' app,"This week, Meta (META) announced its Quest 3 — the company's most affordable VR headset to date. The timing wasn't an accident — Apple (AAPL) is expected to announce its mixed reality headset at the iPhone maker's Worldwide Developers Conference next week.

The VR market is accordingly getting more attention than it has in a while, but the question still lingers: What actually are we supposed to do with these headsets? Gaming, sure, but it seems there's not yet a must-have ""hero"" app for VR yet.

As it turns out, that's pretty much the case — and part of what's held VR back: a hero app, something people absolutely need to buy a headset to play or use. Think about it — what facilitated the AI craze we're in right now? ChatGPT, something everyone could use and understand. A few apps on Meta's Quest have gained large followings, but aren't unequivocally mainstream hits.

""There really hasn't been a metaverse-related app that's taken off,"" said Insider Intelligence Principal Analyst Yory Wurmser. ""Horizon Worlds, for instance, has a few hundred thousand users, tops. The apps that have gained a pretty large following are games, such as Beat Saber, or fitness apps, such as Supernatural. Those two genres are where most of the activity on Quests occurs — games especially."" A promotional image for ""Ghostbusters: Rise of the Ghost Lord,"" provided by Meta.

Meta held its Gaming Showcase on Thursday, unveiling a deluge of new titles for the Quest, tying its new offerings to a wave of high-value intellectual property, including ""Assassin’s Creed Nexus VR,"" ""Stranger Things VR,"" and ""Ghostbusters: Rise of the Ghost Lord."" These showcases are meant to show the breadth and depth of the games you can play on Quest, as the company is trying to both reach as large an audience as possible while hoping that, one of these, will finally be the mega-hit app, said IDC Research Director Ramon Llamas.

""Showcases are just that: an event to announce and present new experiences, apps, and games,"" he said. ""Some of them might see the light of day, others may not, but what I like about it is that there are a variety of titles and game types appealing to different age groups, gaming groups, and numerous other audiences. Glad to see some of these titles coming back for a second or third time too.""

To me, the volume of titles at the Gaming Showcase feels like they were throwing things at the wall to see what sticks. Experts say that that take is, well, only sort of fair.

""I think that's legitimate, but gaming is where things actually are sticking,"" said Wurmser. ""So, I think Meta geared today's showcase to build momentum in the area where Quest — and VR generally — has the most traction."" An image of the Meta Quest 3, provided by the company.

'A clear competitor'

Of course, a hero app won't solve all the problems that VRs have had in gaining traction — but it certainly could, combined with access to other popular games and apps, go a long way.

""It’s important to be known for something, and that also counts for apps,"" said Llamas. ""Having an app that is exclusive to you (like Meta’s Beat Saber) can help, but also important is access to the top tier games available on other gaming platforms.""

Now, Apple's entrance into the headset market will, for the first time, threaten Meta's dominance in the space so far — but in a way, for Meta, it's also a gift.

""Apple brings much-needed attention to the market. It has done this with many of the products the company has released since 2007 when the first iPhone came out,"" said Llamas.

Yes, Apple will likely announce its headset next week, but there are still lots of questions, key among them: What apps will be featured as key to getting the full experience with that Apple headset? That will be something to watch out for Monday, as the ease of use that's historically characterized Apple's devices may color their choices on this front.

""Apple has managed to turn its premium smartphones into mass market goods by virtue of great design and UX,"" said Wurmser. ""If they manage to do that with this headset (unlikely) or ensuing headsets (more likely), it could seriously challenge Meta's VR share.""

And it's very likely that soon, VR's first great race heats up.

""At the very least, Meta will have a clear competitor in terms of software and hardware, and Apple will emerge as a threat to Meta’s first-mover advantage,"" said Llamas. ""It also sets up an arms race for applications, and I think this is where things get really interesting because while a headset gets a person’s attention, the software keeps it there.""

2023-06-02T18:00:31+00:00,Apple's Lesser-Known Co-Founder Owned ⅓ Of The Company But Missed Out On A Potential $900 Billion Fortune,"With the late Steve Jobs and Steve Wozniak, Apple Inc.'s co-founders, dominating the tech world for decades, it’s easy to overlook the vital role played by a lesser-known figure: Mike Markkula.

Don’t Miss: Why Jason Calacanis and Other Silicon Valley Elites Are Betting On This Startups Vision For Re-Uniting American Families

While Jobs and Wozniak captured the limelight, Markkula’s contributions to Apple's success were no less significant. From angel investor to CEO and chairman, Markkula’s journey with Apple showcased his belief in the power of personal computers.

Born on Feb. 11, 1942, in Los Angeles, Markkula was no stranger to the world of technology. Armed with bachelor’s and master’s degrees in electrical engineering from the University of Southern California, this Trojan brother was already well-versed in the intricacies of the field. Markkula’s career at Fairchild Semiconductor International Inc. and Intel Corp., where he retired as a millionaire at the young age of 32, showcased his deep understanding of the tech landscape.

It was during an encounter with Jobs and Wozniak that Markkula’s trajectory took a momentous turn. Recognizing the potential of the Apple II computer, Markkula’s imagination soared. Fueling his conviction with action, Markkula emerged from retirement in 1977, becoming an angel investor in Apple. His $250,000 investment, a combination of loans and equity, solidified his position as the second CEO, third employee and a significant one-third owner of the budding company. In 2023, a one-third stake in Apple would be worth about $900 billion.

This unfortunate reality for Markkula highlights an important lesson for investors and the general potential with longer-term investments and the lucrative but volatile nature of startups. For example, despite the recent decline in venture capital, retail investors have invested over $1 billion through startup investing platforms like StartEngine.

Markkula’s Impact

Markkula, eight years older than Wozniak and 13 years older than Jobs, brought a mature perspective and technical prowess to the table. His contributions to Apple’s early innovations, including writing several programs for the Apple II and beta testing hardware and software, further solidified his importance at the company.

Markkula’s business expertise breathed new life into Apple’s operations. He orchestrated credit arrangements and secured vital venture capital investments, propelling the company forward.

With the appointment of executive Michael Scott as Apple’s first president and CEO, Markkula’s vision for a Fortune 500 company started to take shape. He believed they could achieve that goal within five years. In May 1983, Apple made its debut on the Fortune 500 list at No. 411. Apple become the fastest-growing company in history.

Apple’s sales skyrocketed, with revenue climbing from $773,000 in 1977 to $117 million in 1980, the year of the company's initial public offering. Markkula’s equity investment yielded a 220,552% gain, leaving his shares worth $203 million.

As a CEO himself from 1981 to 1983 and later chairman of the board of directors from 1985 to 1997, Markkula proved to be the steady hand steering Apple through turbulent waters. He played a pivotal role in preserving the Macintosh plan, even when Jobs attempted to derail it multiple times in favor of his own project Lisa.

Markkula’s unwavering support for Macintosh and his alignment with John Sculley, Apple's CEO from 1983 to 1993, during a critical dispute with Jobs ultimately led to Jobs’ departure from the company.

A 1996 article reported that Markkula sold 500,000 shares, amounting to 14% of his stake in the company. But he still retained 3.1 million shares, making him the largest individual shareholder at that time. The sale was attributed to “personal reasons,” as stated by an Apple spokeswoman, although no further details were provided.

Despite retiring from Apple in 1997, shortly after Jobs’ triumphant return as interim CEO, Markkula’s impact continued to resonate. He supported Jobs’ comeback and, more importantly, left behind a legacy of keen decision-making. Markkula’s intuition, especially when it came to the personal computer market, proved spot-on.

2023-06-02T16:08:36+00:00,Stock market today: Dow in weekly win on blowout jobs report; U.S. averts default,"Investing.com -- The Dow racked up gains Friday, wrapping up a weekly win as investors cheered strong labor market data, and news the debt-ceiling bill could likely be signed into law as soon as Saturday to avert a U.S. default.

The Dow Jones Industrial Average gained 2.1%, or 701 points, the Nasdaq gained 1.1% to close at 52-week highs, and the S&P 500 was up 1.4%.

The U.S. economy created 339,000 new jobs in May, well above the 180,000 expected, though the unemployment rate rose more than expected to 3.7% and wage growth climbed less than expected.

Following the better-than-expected job gains in May, Morgan Stanley said they continued to “see the Fed on hold at the June meeting, and think the bar will be too high for the Fed to resume hiking.”

On Capitol Hill, meanwhile, a measure to lift the debt limit and cut government spending was passed in the Senate, a key final hurdle for the legislative measure, which now moves onto President Biden’s desk to be signed into law and averts an unprecedented default.

[W]e’re going to work very quickly with them to get this done to make sure we can sign it, hopefully as soon as tomorrow,” Press Secretary Karine Jean-Pierre said Friday, responding to questions about when Biden might sign the legislative measure.

Energy stocks led the move higher for the second day in a row as oil prices gained on speculation that OPEC and its allies, or OPEC+, could announce a cut at its meeting in Vienna on Sunday.

“The decision to hold an in-person meeting in Vienna one month before everyone returns for the OPEC Seminar does raise the prospect that the group could decide to do a deeper cut to provide further support to the market as it continues to contend with broader macro concerns,” RBC said in a note.

Materials were also in the ascendency, driven by a 7% surge in Dupont De Nemours Inc (NYSE:DD) after the chemical company -- together with Chemours Co (NYSE:CC) and Corteva Inc (NYSE:CTVA) -- reached an agreement to settle allegations that they contaminated public water systems with toxic perfluoroalkyl and polyfluoroalkyl, substances (PFAS), or so-called forever chemicals.

Tech lagged the gains in the broader market, though remains set to end the week with strong gains following the AI-related surge in chip stocks this week including Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA).

Broadcom Inc (NASDAQ:AVGO) rose nearly 3% after reporting quarterly results that topped estimates, and saying that it expects more than a quarter of fiscal 2024 revenue to be driven by generative AI models such as ChatGPT.

Ahead of its developer conference that kicks off on Monday, Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL) was slightly higher after Morgan Stanley hiked its price on the target to $190 from $185 on optimism that the tech giant will launch its new virtual reality headset that will boost growth.

“Our supply chain checks tell us Reality Pro general availability will likely come in the Dec '23 quarter, and that builds will ramp from 300,000 to 500,000 in calendar 2023, to 3M to 4M by 2025,” it added.

Elsewhere on the earnings front, Lululemon Athletica (NASDAQ:LULU) lifted its guidance after reporting quarterly results that topped estimates, sending its shares up almost 12%.

SentinelOne Inc (NYSE:S) slumped 35% after the cybersecurity company cut its annual sales outlook after reporting quarterly revenue that fell short of Wall Street estimates amid a weaker macroeconomic backdrop.

Energy stocks led the move higher for the second day in a row as oil prices gained on speculation that OPEC and its allies, or OPEC+, could announce a cut at its meeting in Vienna on Sunday.

“The decision to hold an in-person meeting in Vienna one month before everyone returns for the OPEC Seminar does raise the prospect that the group could decide to do a deeper cut to provide further support to the market as it continues to contend with broader macro concerns,” RBC said in a note.

Materials were also in the ascendency, driven by an 8% surge in Dupont De Nemours Inc (NYSE:DD) after the chemical company -- together with Chemours Co (NYSE:CC) and Corteva Inc (NYSE:CTVA) -- reached an agreement to settle allegations that they contaminated public water systems with toxic perfluoroalkyl and polyfluoroalkyl, substances (PFAS), or so-called forever chemicals.

Tech lagged the gains in the broader market, though remains set to end the week with strong gains following the AI-related surge in chip stocks this week including Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA).

Broadcom Inc (NASDAQ:AVGO) rose nearly 3% after reporting quarterly results that topped estimates, and saying that it expects more than a quarter of fiscal 2024 revenue to be driven by generative AI models such as ChatGPT.

Ahead its developer conference that kicks off on Monday, Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL) was slightly higher after Morgan Stanley hiked its price on the target to $190 from $185 on optimism that the tech giant will launch its new virtual reality headset that will boost growth.

“Our supply chain checks tell us Reality Pro general availability will likely come in the Dec '23 quarter, and that builds will ramp from 300,000 to 500,000 in calendar 2023, to 3M to 4M by 2025,” it added.

Elsewhere on the earnings front, Lululemon Athletica (NASDAQ:LULU) lifted its guidance after reporting quarterly results that topped estimates, sending its shares up 12%.

SentinelOne Inc (NYSE:S) slumped 36% after the cybersecurity company cut its annual sales outlook after reporting quarterly revenue that fell short of Wall Street estimates amid a weaker macroeconomic backdrop.

HP’s competitor, Dell Technologies Inc (NYSE: DELL) also crushed estimates with its latest quarter thanks to its cost management execution, but unlike HP, it wasn’t as optimistic with its guidance. Overall, this was a pleasant surprise from PC makers, as back in April, even the mighty Apple Inc (NASDAQ: AAPL) showed its Mac shipments tanked 40.5% during the first quarter of the year. As far as largest computer makers go, Apple saw the biggest decline, but everyone, including Asus and Lenovo saw drops in shipments and weakened demand.

HP’s Fiscal Second Quarter Highlights

For the quarter ended on April 30th, HP saw its revenue take a 22% YoY plunge as it amounted to $12.9 billion. However, despite the lighter revenue, net earnings amounted to $1.07 billion, or 80 cents a share, topping last year’s comparable quarter when they amounted to $1 billion, or 95 cents a share. When restructuring costs and other charges are taken aside, HP earned $1.07 a share, dropping from last year’s fiscal quarter when it made $1.10 a share. Meanwhile, Fact Set survey of analysts guided for net earnings of 49 cents per share on revenue of $7.3 billion.

HP’s Third Quarter Guidance

Revenue is expected in the range between $6.7 billion to $7.2 billion, at the lower end of Fact Set’s guidance with earnings in line with Fact Set’s estimate in the range between 44 cents and 48 cents a share.

Dell’s First Quarter Highlights And Guidance

For the quarter ended in April, Dell normalized its supply chain, lowering its operating expenses 6% to $3.57 billion. Revenue did drop 20% to $20.92 billion but still topped Refinitiv’s consensus of $20.27 billion. The consumer and enterprise PC business unit saw a 23% drop in revenue, while the infrastructure unit that houses servers, storage and networking hardware experienced an 18% drop in revenue. Adjusted earnings amounted to $1.31 per share, topping estimates of 86 cents. But, due to cautious IT spending, Dell guided for second quarter revenue in the range between $20.2 billion and $21.2 billion, which the highest point of the range being the midpoint of analyst expectations, according to Reuters.

AI Is Bringing A New Kind Of PCs

HP CEO Enrique Lores told CNBC that AI will radically change the fundamentals of the PC industry and therefore, HP. For one thing, AI will power PCs to analyze data in record time. Therefore, Lores expects the industry to be truly refreshed as the customer experience will be redefined by this utterly new architecture. These innovative AI-powered models are expected to hit the market as early as next year.  Even Apple has boarded software engineers to exploit the opportunities of generative AI. What is certain is that everyone agrees that AI is transforming the way people interact with technology and what technology can do but it seems even the mighty Apple is lagging on this front.

HP Recap

Amid an unfavorable macroeconomy, both computing giants showed an exemplary execution of cost-control strategies. But HP did not only protect the margins of both its PC and printing segment as it also raised its full year guidance, despite consumers being more cautious about their IT spending. HP showed that disciplined execution can make a powerful difference and even Wall Street is impressed how good it navigated through the economic storm. HP CEO expects PC sales to recover in the remaining half of the year and relies on AI to fuel its future growth as it will redefine what PCs can do.

According to the IDC report, PC manufacturers can expect a recovery as 2023 nears its close. Even Apple, whose share of the PC market shrank, is expected to benefit from the eagerly anticipated rebound.

2023-06-02T14:56:58+00:00,"In challenge to Meta, Apple expected to unveil mixed-reality headset","By Stephen Nellis

SAN FRANCISCO (Reuters) - Apple Inc is widely expected to announce a new headset that will blend video of the outside world with the virtual one at its annual software developer conference next week.

Apple CEO Tim Cook and Meta Platforms Inc's CEO, Mark Zuckerberg, are jockeying to define how consumers will put to use a new generation of technology where real and digital worlds converge.

Zuckerberg has laid out a vision of the ""metaverse,"" a parallel digital universe where people will gather together to work and play, and has had products out for years.

Apple marketing chief Greg Joswiak, by contrast, recently called the metaverse ""a word I'll never use."" And Apple's device so far is just a rumor. Apple's presentations at its Worldwide Developers Conference start at 10 a.m. PDT (1700 GMT) in California on Monday.

Until now, the company best known for iPhones has limited its augmented-reality efforts to technology that works on existing devices, for instance by enabling retailers' apps to show virtual furniture in a customer's living room.

""Meta and Apple are competing with each other. The difference is that Meta is doing it publicly, while Apple is doing it privately,"" said Anshel Sag, principal analyst at Moor Insights & Strategy.

Analysts say that the Apple device, which Bloomberg has reported could cost near $3,000 and look like a pair of ski goggles, is a place holder of sorts. The Cupertino, California, company's grand vision remains to produce a pair of transparent glasses that overlay digital information on the real world and can be worn all day, every day, those analysts say, but in the face of competition, it decided to launch its own goggles.

Apple declined to comment on its future plans and products.

NO 'KILLER APP' YET

The technology for Apple glasses remains years away, and in the meantime, Apple's rivals such as Sony Group Corp and Pico, which is owned by TikTok parent ByteDance, have released mixed-reality headsets that hint at what is possible by blending the real and virtual worlds. Meta Platforms this week announced its Quest 3 headset for $500, after last year's release of the Quest Pro, which sells for $1,000.

Apple has been pushing augmented-reality features for its iPhones and iPads since 2017, but its mainstream uses have remained limited to mostly furniture-shopping apps and a handful of games.

Part of the reason Apple has kept its efforts private, analysts say, is that no one in Silicon Valley is quite sure how people will eventually use mixed- or augmented-reality technology, which industry insiders call ""XR"" for short. There is no ""killer app"" for the device yet.

So rather than target a mass-market price point, Apple appears to be readying a premium device that is aimed at showing software developers what is possible so they can come up with compelling apps.

""No one there believes this market is anywhere near ripe in the foreseeable future,"" said Ben Bajarin, chief executive and principal analyst at Creative Strategies.

The biggest risk for Apple is putting its reputation for polished products on the line while engaging in a costly battle with Meta for dominance over a market that barely exists yet. Last year, Meta had 80% of an overall market for augmented- and virtual-reality headsets that was just 8.8 million units, according to data from research firm IDC. By contrast, IDC estimates that Apple alone sold 226 million iPhones.

While Meta has products on the market, Apple has major advantages in defining the emerging field among software developers, said Jitesh Ubrani, a research manager who tracks the XR market at IDC. Apple has strong relationships with developers who want to access an installed base of 2 billion devices that spans Macs, Apple Watches, iPhones and more.

""They can leverage that ecosystem they've already built to keep users within their walled garden,"" Ubrani said. ""And Apple is in a much better position to give you an experience that works across devices than Meta is.""

2023-06-02T14:40:55+00:00,"Apple WWDC 2023: AR/VR headset, Macs, and more expected","Apple’s (AAPL) Worldwide Developers Conference (WWDC) kicks off at 1 p.m. ET on June 5, and if the rumors are to be believed, it could be one of the biggest Apple events in recent history. That’s because the iPhone maker is largely expected to launch its long-awaited VR/AR headset at the big show.

The headset, which Apple has been working on for years, would be the first new major product category from Apple since it debuted the Apple Watch in 2014. And there’s a lot riding on the device. Not only will the headset have a direct impact on CEO Tim Cook’s legacy, it could also determine Apple’s future beyond the iPhone.

While the VR/AR headgear will certainly be the star of the show, it’s not the only thing Apple will show off. Here’s everything we expect out of the tech giant at WWDC 2023.

The Reality Pro headset

Apple’s headset, which Bloomberg’s Mark Gurman says will be called the Reality Pro, will likely be all people are talking about after the event. Gurman, who seemingly has a preternatural ability to find out what’s going on inside Apple’s walls, says the headset will cost around $3,000 and feature a design similar to a pair of ski goggles.

The Reality Pro will reportedly be a mixed reality device with a dial on the side that allows users to swap between fully-occluded VR and an AR experience that lays interactive digital graphics over the real world. According to Gurman, the Reality headset will be powered by one of Apple’s M2 chips and require a separate power pack that you’ll keep in your pocket.

The Reality Pro’s displays, meanwhile, will have plenty of visual oomph. According to Ross Young, CEO of Display Supply Chain Consultants, the headset will feature two 1.41-inch microLED displays and a resolution of 4K per eye.

As for content, Gurman says Apple is looking to throw everything it can at the headset ranging from sports offerings to productivity apps and video games. After all, regardless of how good the hardware is for the Reality Pro, it’ll need the right kind of content to get people interested in using it beyond the first 10 minutes of trying it on. Sign up for the Yahoo Finance newsletter.

Apple isn’t exactly coming into a crowded market. Facebook parent Meta (META) controls roughly 80% of the global VR/AR headset market thanks to its Quest products. The social media company introduced a new headset on June 1, cutting off Apple’s own announcement.

Still, ensuring the Reality Pro is a hit will be a tall task given the product category’s relatively lackluster pick up among consumers.

iOS 17, iPadOS, and watchOS

The company is also expected to debut the latest versions of its various operating systems. This is a developers conference after all.

Apple’s iOS 17 and iPadOS 17 will likely make their first appearances at the show and include a handful of improvements, including more uses for the iPhone 14 Pro’s Dynamic Island and potentially a deeper dive into the iPhone’s updated CarPlay platform.

According to The Wall Street Journal, Apple will also show off a new journaling app designed to be used as part of its health offerings. The app will reportedly feature a means of tracking your daily activity to get a better sense of your overall mood and help with general observations about user health. Apple’s iPadOS 17 should also get its own dedicated health app, as well as the ability to customize the lock screen.

The Apple Watch is also set to get some interesting software updates in the form of a new interface focused on widgets that will make it easier to access certain app features without having to open the entire program, Bloomberg reports.

New Macs

Apple is also reportedly working on a slew of new Mac computers that could debut at WWDC. According to Gurman, you should expect to see a 15-inch MacBook Air with an M2 processor, as well as two desktops: one running Apple’s M2 Max chip and another with a new M2 Ultra processor.

The report indicates that the desktops should be new versions of Apple’s Mac Studio. That computer is meant to be a powerhouse system for professionals in need of strong performance in a compact package.

There’s no telling if Apple will actually roll out all of these products, or if it will have others we don’t yet know about. The only way to find out? Stay tuned to Yahoo Finance for all the latest news.
